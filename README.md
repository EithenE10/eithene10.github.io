Real Estate Website - Eithen's Estates

This is my real estate company website I developed from scratch alone. Contains alot of CSS/HTML but is responsive and allows back end support like adding properties/testimonials
/vendors and the ability to edit properties/testimonials and vendors also. Also contains a search function and a responsive design throughout. Would reccomend importing into XAMPP to view.
